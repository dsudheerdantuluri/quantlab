
This problem will require you to write an application that will read an input file ('input.csv') and write out a new file calculated from the inputs. Please use C++ for this project.

We are looking for an object oriented, flexible solution, even though it may not seem required for this application. We will evaluate your submission based on the following criteria:
•	Design & Construction
•	Tests
•	Use of modern C++14/17 Idioms
•	Use of C++ TMP where appropriate
•	Correctness

We are big fans of test driven development (TDD), but if you don’t have experience with it, code using your regular style instead of trying to learn on this project. Please aim to spend about an hour to complete this exercise. Send your source code and output.csv in a zipped git repo back for evaluation when complete. Include the amount of time you spent working on the solution.
-enjoy!

_______________________________________________________________________________

Input:
The input file represents a very simplified stream of trades on an exchange.  
Each row represents a trade.  If you don't know what that means don't worry.  
The data can be thought of as a time series of values in columns: 

<TimeStamp>,<Symbol>,<Quantity>,<Price>

Although the provided input file is small, the solution should be able to handle 
a source dataset well beyond the amount memory and hard disk space on your machine.

Definitions
- TimeStamp is value indicating the microseconds since midnight.
- Symbol is the 3 character unique identifier for a financial 
  instrument (Stock, future etc.)
- Quantity is the amount traded
- Price is the price of the trade for that financial instrument.

Safe Assumptions:
- TimeStamp is always for the same day and won't roll over midnight.
- TimeStamp is increasing or same as previous tick (time gap will never be < 0).
- Price - our currency is an integer based currency.  No decimal points.
- Price - Price is always > 0.

Example: here is a row for a trade of 10 shares of aaa stock at a price of 12 
1234567,aaa,10,12

Problem:
Find the following on a per symbol basis:
- Maximum time gap
  (time gap = Amount of time that passes between consecutive trades of a symbol)
  if only 1 trade is in the file then the gap is 0.
- Total Volume traded (Sum of the quantity for all trades in a symbol).
- Max Trade Price.
- Weighted Average Price.  Average price per unit traded not per trade.
  Result should be truncated to whole numbers.

  Example: the following trades
	20 shares of aaa @ 18
	5 shares of aaa @ 7
	Weighted Average Price = ((20 * 18) + (5 * 7)) / (20 + 5) = 15

Output:
Your solution should produce a file called 'output.csv'.
file should be a comma separate file with this format:
<symbol>,<MaxTimeGap>,<Volume>,<WeightedAveragePrice>,<MaxPrice>

The output should be sorted by symbol ascending ('aaa' should be first).

Sample Input:
52924702,aaa,13,1136
52924702,aac,20,477
52925641,aab,31,907
52927350,aab,29,724
52927783,aac,21,638
52930489,aaa,18,1222
52931654,aaa,9,1077
52933453,aab,9,756

Sample Output:
aaa,5787,40,1161,1222
aab,6103,69,810,907
aac,3081,41,559,638

Send your source code and output.csv in a zipped git repo back for evaluation when complete.
Include the amount of time you spent working on the solution.
